## TIPS for Exploring
Remember to always carry Yen, some places do take credit card but not all. We always carried bathroom wipes and hand sanitizer as some of the restrooms in these locations did not supply it!

Having a garbage bag in your vehicle will come in handy, most places do not have garbage cans and ask that you take your garbage with you, please do your part in keeping this island beautiful.
